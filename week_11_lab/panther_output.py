"""unfortunatly I was unable to run a ttest to determine the significantly different 
genes between early and late developmental stages according to the paper.
I was able to determine which were up and down regulated based off of the above
2 or less than .5 intensity ration that the paper used though. without the ttest
it was impossible for me to determine the correct gene, and associated cluster of genes
that was meant to be run through panther. Instead, just to show I can utalize panther
and understand the output, I chose a gene at random from the upregulated gene output
list that I obtained from the first level of gene expression analysis. the gene I chose
was Icam2"""

what I determined about Icam2 from panther is that it is called 
intercellular adhesion molecule 2, and its main proteins classes are
as a signaling molecule, as well as a member of the immunogloublin
superfamily cell adhesion molecules. the GO terms state that is molecular
function is for receptor and protein binding, it is involved in the biological
processes of cell adhesion, and it is a cellular component of the membrane. other proteins 
in this family include icam1, icam4, tcam1, and icam5. 

A potential role of icam2 in differentiation may include cell movememt and adhesion to
the proper tissues. during development the proper location of cells, and what other cells
they contact is important to forming functional tissues, and therefore a protein involved
in cellular adhesion would imply a role during differentiation as a facilitator of proper protein
contact interactions to hold the differentiating cells in the proper location near the proper
neighbors to create a functional tissue.
