Prose for the effects that I saw:

snpEff was not backward compatable to utalize the mouse mm9 genome, therefore 
I cannot determine the consequence of each filtered variant. 

It would have been possible to go back and rerun all prior steps 
using the mm10 genome, but then our results would not have matched 
the papers results. Had the program worked we would have extected to see 
that for each variant in the vcf files we would have seen what the program 
predicted the variant to be and we could have then compared that to the papers results.
